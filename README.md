The Alexa App Challenge

http://calagator.org/events/1250471016

Alexa by Amazon is unique among the interactive voice devices being offered in the market today, in that it is an open platform, and open for developers to add skills.  You can't teach Siri, Google, or Cortana how to engage with you (yet!), but you can program Alexa, and in Javascript no less.

This month, we're going to do an Alexa challenge.  We'll devide up into teams and get to work on adding Skills to Alexa through the use of Amazon's Lambda service.  Don't worry if you have never programmed Alexa before, we'll use the excellent alexa-app project to get started, and will even have a working template to begin building on.

Plenty of Echo devices will be on hand, enough for each team to work with one.
